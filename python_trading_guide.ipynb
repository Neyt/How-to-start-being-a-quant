    "In this initial lesson, the instructor focused on providing the basics of Python. The goal is for us to become familiar with the syntax. The instructor mentioned that we donâ€™t need to become Python experts. The lesson covers the simplest aspects of the Python programming language, such as comments, up to the more complex ones, like classes. We will go through each concept one by one to understand, practice, and take notes on new things we learn."
